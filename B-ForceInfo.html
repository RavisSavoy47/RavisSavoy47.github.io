            <p>B-Force is a 3rd person racing game where you play as a worker bee named Darbee, the objective of the game is to attempt to complete a race track within the least amount of time possible. You can use speed boosts and drifting to help speed up Darbee in order to decrease the time.</p>

            <p>When making Hazards, I wanted them to slow down the player if they ever hit a Hazard. Their are 3 different types of Hazards, basic hazard, a spiderweb hazard, and a moving hazard. The basic hazard is a stationary object that is placed throughout the track. The spiderweb hazard is a stationary object that checks the speed of the player, and if the player is fast enough the player can break through without being stopped. The moving hazard is a basic hazard that moves between two points.</p>
            
            <p><img class="portrait" src="assets/img/TimeManager.gif"/></p>
            <p>I created a time manager that keeps track of time spent on the track. I works by getting the delta time from the scene and increases the seconds by using the delta time. When ever the seconds are greater than or equal to 60 it increases the minutes and resets the seconds to 0. When the player reaches the finishline it saves the time when the finishline was hit and displays that laps time.</p>
