            <p>Here is more indepth information about systems that I developed during the creation of Yokai Invasion.</p>
            
            <p><img class="portrait" src="assets/img/PlayerMovement.gif"/></p>

            <p>I created the player movement that get the player's input and moves per lane. The player lerps its position to either lane's position by the input. </p>

            <p><img class="portrait" src="assets/img/DamagePowerUP.gif"/><img class="portrait" src="assets/img/NinjaPowerUP.gif"/></p>
            

            <P>I created a system of power ups in the game that drop after an enemy is defeated. The first power up is a damage boost it increase the amount of damage an attack does, while also chaning the color of the attack. The ninja power up summons two ninjas on two of the lanes and they attack with the player.</P>
